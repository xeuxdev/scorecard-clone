        id: "how-is-bias-detected",
        question: "How does Lambda detect bias in AI systems?",
        answer:
          "Lambda analyzes model predictions across demographic groups, user segments, and data slices to identify systematic performance differences. Our bias detection framework measures disparities in accuracy, false positive/negative rates, and confidence scores across protected attributes. We surface actionable insights to help you understand and mitigate fairness issues.",
